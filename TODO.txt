BUGS:
=====
ground:
    - Flickering of selected image when new images are added.
    - Canon camera not working when run from the rc.local script - probably due to permission issues of the root.
    - GUI doesn't shutdown properly, maybe gets stuck on some open process
airborne:
    - Settings of camera (zoom, shutter etc) are not persistent
    - Turning off 'Shooting' can cause the camera to disconnect.
    - If the camera is disconnected, it might not be in 'rec' mode. 'Shooting' doesn't set the camera in 'rec' mode.
